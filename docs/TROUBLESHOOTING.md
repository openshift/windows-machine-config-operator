# Troubleshooting guide

## WMCO does not go to running
Please check if you are using an OKD/OCP 4.6 cluster running on Azure or AWS, configured with
[hybrid OVN Kubernetes networking](setup-hybrid-OVNKubernetes-cluster.md).

## Windows Machine does not become a worker node
There could be various reasons as to why a Windows Machine does not become a worker node. Please collect the WMCO logs
by executing:
```shell script
oc logs -f deployment/windows-machine-config-operator -n openshift-windows-machine-config-operator
```
File a GitHub issue and attach the logs to the issue along with the *MachineSet* used.

## Windows Server 2019 LTSC (1809) nodes never become Ready
Ensure that you have not configured the cluster with a
[custom VXLAN port](setup-hybrid-OVNKubernetes-cluster.md#vSphere) as that is not a supported feature in 1809.

## Accessing a Windows node
Windows nodes cannot be accessed using `oc debug node` as that requires running a privileged pod on the node which is
not yet supported for Windows. Instead, a Windows node can be accessed using SSH or RDP. An
[SSH bastion](https://github.com/eparis/ssh-bastion) needs to be setup for both methods. The following information is
common across both methods:
* The key used in the *cloud-private-key* [secret](../README.md#Usage) and the key used when creating the cluster should
  be added to the [ssh-agent](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-default.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-azure-default).
  For [security reasons](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/openssh-client/ssh.1.en.html#A) we suggest removing the keys
  from the ssh-agent after use.
* *\<username\>* is *Administrator* (AWS) or *capi* (Azure)
* *\<windows-node-internal-ip\>* is the internal IP address of the node, which can be discovered by:
  ```shell script
  oc get nodes <node-name> -o jsonpath={.status.addresses[?\(@.type==\"InternalIP\"\)].address}
  ```
Once the SSH bastion has been setup, you can use either method to access the Windows node.
### SSH
* Access the Windows node using the following commands:
  ```shell script
  ssh -t -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ProxyCommand='ssh -A -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -W %h:%p core@$(oc get service --all-namespaces -l run=ssh-bastion -o go-template="{{ with (index (index .items 0).status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{ or .hostname .ip }}{{end}}")' <username>@<windows-node-internal-ip>
  ```

### RDP
* Execute the following command to set up an SSH tunnel:
  ```shell script
  ssh -L 2020:<windows-node-internal-ip>:3389 core@$(oc get service --all-namespaces -l run=ssh-bastion -o go-template="{{ with (index (index .items 0).status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{ or .hostname .ip }}{{end}}")
  ```
  Do not exit the resulting shell.
* SSH into the Windows node and execute the following command to create a password for the user:
  ```powershell
  <username>@<node-name> C:\Users\username> net user <username> *
  ```
* You can now RDP into the Windows node at *localhost:2020* using an RDP client

## How to collect Kubernetes node logs
Kubernetes node log files are in *C:\var\logs*. To view all the directories under *C:\var\logs*, execute:
```shell script
$ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=/
ip-10-0-138-252.us-east-2.compute.internal containers/
ip-10-0-138-252.us-east-2.compute.internal hybrid-overlay/
ip-10-0-138-252.us-east-2.compute.internal kube-proxy/
ip-10-0-138-252.us-east-2.compute.internal kubelet/
ip-10-0-138-252.us-east-2.compute.internal pods/
```
You can now list files in the directories using the same command and view the individual log files. For example to view
the kubelet logs, you can execute:
```shell script
$ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=/kubelet/kubelet.log
```
## How to collect Windows application event logs

The Get-WinEvent shim on the kubelet logs endpoint can be used to collect application event logs from Windows machines.
E.g. for the docker runtime service:
```shell script
$ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=journal -u docker
```
The same command is executed when collecting logs with `oc adm must-gather`.

Other Windows application logs from the EventLog can also be collected by specifying the respective service on a `-u` flag.
To view logs from all applications logging to the event logs on the Windows machine, run:
```shell script
$ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=journal
```

Alternatively, the Docker event logs can be viewed using SSH with the following steps:
* SSH into the Windows node and enter PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  <username>@<node-name> C:\Users\username> powershell
  ```
* Now you can view the Docker logs by executing:
  ```powershell
  PS C:\Users\username> Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source Docker
  ```

## How to collect a packet trace on Windows nodes
* An SSH [bastion](https://github.com/eparis/ssh-bastion) must first be deployed
* Use the hack/packet_trace.sh utility to start a trace
  ```shell script
  packet_trace.sh -i $SSH_KEY start $WIN_NODE_NAME
  ```
* Start the activity you wish to trace
* Stop the packet trace, downloading the trace files to the current directory
  ```shell script
  packet_trace.sh -i $SSH_KEY stop $WIN_NODE_NAME
  ```
